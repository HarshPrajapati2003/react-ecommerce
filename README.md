Our admin dashboard is the heart of Shop Haven. It empowers administrators with powerful tools to efficiently manage orders, visualize sales data, and perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. Admins can also sort the product list based on various parameters like price, order time, and order ID. 📊👨‍💼🔧

### Redux-Powered State Management 🔄🚀

Shop Haven employs Redux Toolkit for robust state management. This ensures a well-organized and structured codebase, minimizing unnecessary network calls and improving application performance and maintainability. 🔄🚀📈
